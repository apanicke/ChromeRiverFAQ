  <h3 style="font-family:Benton Sans";>Discuss creating an expense report prior to travel.</h3>
  <p style="font-family:Benton Sans;">Keep in mind that there will be no pre trip approval in CR, however, you can create an expense report prior to the travel. This will allow you to forward receipts directly to the report as you are traveling. It will remain in a draft/saved status. It also allows you to include any prepaid transactions through travel vendors.</p>
</LI> 
<LI>
  <h3 style="font-family:Benton Sans";>How will prepay through Egencia work with CR?</h3>
  <p style="font-family:Benton Sans;">Because there are no trip ID’s, the transaction will be associated with the traveler’s Employee ID. This information will be passed from the booking agency to US Bank via the transaction detail. US Bank will then feed this information to CR where the transaction will post to the individual’s e-wallet. Either the traveler or the delegate will move the transaction from the e-wallet onto the report where it will be charged to the department account upon final approval. If the transaction is for a non-employee, the transaction will be associated with the arranger’s Employee ID (the person who booked the travel arrangement). The arranger/delegate will need to create an expense report for the non-employee traveler and include the prepaid transaction from the arranger’s e-wallet.</p>

<LI>
 <h3 style="font-family:Benton Sans";>Since there will be no Travel Authorizations in Chrome River, can departments create an internal form to track anticipated spend as well as travel dates and locations for traveler safety?</h3>
  <p style="font-family:Benton Sans;">Absolutely. If your department feels it is helpful to capture this detail, you can develop an internal process specific to those needs.</p>
</LI>
<LI>
 <h3 style="font-family:Benton Sans";>How will trip limits work?</h3>
  <p style="font-family:Benton Sans;">Approvers will have the ability to reduce expense amounts to accommodate account limits. It will be important for the traveler to understand that there are limits on this trip prior to the travel.</p>
</LI>
<LI>
  <h3 style="font-family:Benton Sans";>How will routing work in Chrome River?</h3>
  <p style="font-family:Benton Sans;">Initiator (traveler or delegate) creates the report and submits it. The document routes to the transaction approver for review and approval. The transaction approver also audits for policy compliance, department account, etc. The doc then routes to Travel for final approval (note if the doc is mileage only or the expense is less than $75, it will be final approved upon the approval by the transaction approver – the doc does not route to Travel in these instances).</p>
</LI>
<LI>
  <h3 style="font-family:Benton Sans";>Can the Fiscal Officer change account information?</h3>
  <p style="font-family:Benton Sans;">Yes…the FO can change the account, add accounts, add allocations to various account and/or change the requested expense account.</p>
</LI>
<LI>
  <h3 style="font-family:Benton Sans";>Can an Initiator enter a mileage deduction?</h3>
  <p style="font-family:Benton Sans;">Initiators do not have the ability to enter a mileage deduction. However, the transaction approver is able to use the “Adjust” button to decrease the mileage calculation as needed.</p>
</LI>
<LI>
  <h3 style="font-family:Benton Sans";>How do Travel Advances work?</h3>
  <p style="font-family:Benton Sans;">Advances are requested using the Cash Advance report type. Upon final approval, the cash advance amount will be placed in the traveler’s cash advance bank within Chrome River. When the advance amount is fully substantiated and the reimbursement is final approved, the cash advance balance will be cleared. The traveler will receive reimbursement for the excess amount paid out of pocket. If the advance it not fully substantiated or the traveler received excess advance funds that were not used, the excess amount will need to be deposited into the department account via a KFS Cash Receipt document. Travel will need to be made aware of the KFS Cash Receipt document number so they can clear the cash advance bank within Chrome River.</p>
    </LI>
<LI>
	<h3 style="font-family:Benton Sans";>How are account listed when doing a search?</h3>
  <p style="font-family:Benton Sans;">When entering an account to search, the results will display with the account and the sub-account/s first. If you only want the main account and not any sub-accounts, be sure to scroll down to bypass the sub-accounts.</p>
  </LI>
<LI>
  <h3 style="font-family:Benton Sans";>How does accumulated mileage work?</h3>
  <p style="font-family:Benton Sans;">Chrome River has a tile titled under ‘Ground Transportation’, ‘Accumulated Mileage’.</p>
  <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">
  <img src="C:\Users\apanicke\Desktop\ChromeRiverFAQ\Images\Picture1.png" alt="Action Required Email" style="width: 600px; height: 400px; margin-left: 35px;" border="1">
</div>
</LI>
<LI>
    <h3 style="font-family:Benton Sans";>Will there be an electronic mileage form or do we still use the paper form?</h3>
  <p style="font-family:Benton Sans;">The mileage record is captured electronically so there is no need to use the paper form unless you would like it for documentation/record keeping purposes.
For accumulated mileage, we still need the mileage log that is on the Travel Management Website as a receipt.</p>
</LI>
<LI>
  <h3 style="font-family:Benton Sans";>Can we use IUIE with Chrome River?</h3>
  <p style="font-family:Benton Sans;">We anticipate that some standard reports from Chrome River will be integrated into IUIE. However, the main data source for Chrome River transactions expense detail will reside within Chrome River. The Chrome River Analytics tool is a very dynamic and robust tool for accessing data.</p>
      </LI>
<LI>
	  <h3 style="font-family:Benton Sans";>Will documents be viewable and searchable within Chrome River?</h3>
  <p style="font-family:Benton Sans;">Chrome River does not have a “search” feature. However, travelers and delegates will have access the Expense Report detail within their user accounts.
Fiscal Officers and Transaction Approvers will have access through analytics. You can report by traveler, expense type, accounts etc., and can drill down into specific reports.</p>
  </LI>
<LI>

    </LI>
<LI>
	<h3 style="font-family:Benton Sans";>Will Chrome River identify if a traveler has another trip in the system with the same dates?</h3>
